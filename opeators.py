# In Python, there are many operators I'll share all operators with examples.

# Mathematical Operator :  +, -, *, /


# num1 = 20
# num2 = 5
# print(num1+num2) # Add
# print(num1-num2) # Subtraction
# print(num1*num2) # Multiplication
# print(num1/num2) # Division

# # User Input

# a = int(input("Enter First Number: "))
# b = int(input("Enter Second Number: "))

# print("Your Sum is: ", a + b)
# print("Your Sub is: ", a - b)
# print("Your Mul is: ", a * b)
# print("Your Div is: ", a / b)

# # Assignment Operator : =, +=, -=

# a = 5  # I'm assigning 5 to a.
# a += 10  # adding 10 in 5(a)
# a -= 2  # subtracting 2 in a(5)
# print(a)

# Comparison Operator: ==, >, <, >=, <=, !=

# a = 10
# b = 15

# print(a == b) # here I'm comparing a is equal to b, so the output is False
# print(a > b) #Fasle
# print(a < b) #True
# print(a >= b) #False
# print(a <= b) #True
# print(a != b) #True


# Logical Operator : and, or, not

# a = 10
# b = 20
# c = 10

# print(a==b and a==c) # and is basically to correct all the statement
# print(a==b or a==c) # or is basically to correct anyone of the statement

# print(not(True)) # not is reversal True to False => False to True
